# script made to be used with FlyBase and GeneOntology.org files.
# there is an option to update the GO_desc12_condensed_parents.txt file - set to True by default (update_go_desc=1, change 0 to turn it off). It is written as option to make the script usable by people who don't need this file in their pipeline.
# this script requires the following two files to be in the same directory as this script:
# file 1: gene_association.fb
# file 2: go.obo
# the script will generate a new file linking a giving FBgn ID to all its GO terms and their parents (including is_a, part_of, intersection_of, and regulates).
# the only argument required by the script if the name of the output file.
# if "GO_desc12" option is true, the GO_desc12_condensed_parents.txt file should also be in the same directory.
# the script will create an updated GO_desc12_condensed_parents.txt and will name it GO_desc12_condensed_parents_updated.txt

# I am also adding an option to turn off the GO_gene_cats update (that uses flybase and geneontology information). go_gene_cats = 0 (off) or 1 (on)
